<h1>Use of Internet Explorer</h1>

Internet Explorer ignores all internet standards regarding page styling, and thus I can't be asked to adjust my pages over and over again to comply with this crappy browser.<br />
Everything on this website is designed and tested on Google Chrome, and will most likely work in all browsers but Internet Explorer.<br />
If you want to save developers like me a ton of work, <b>stop using Internet Explorer now</b>.<br />
Use a real browser like <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> if you want to view any webpages as they are intended to be viewed.<br />
<br />
If you are not convinced yet, just <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Why+is+Internet+Explorer+a+bad+browser%3F">google it</a>.<br />
Also, stay away from Bing, it's evil.<br />
