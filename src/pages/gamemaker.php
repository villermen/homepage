    <h1>Gamemaker</h1>
    Back in 2008 I started coding (or just plain drag-and-dropping at first) in Gamemaker.<br />
    It basically taught me how coding languages and objects worked.<br />I also made some pretty simple games/programs with it over time.<br />
    All the programs listed below were made with GameMaker 7, which was the latest version at the time I was using it.<br />
    I won't make any more games/programs with it due to it's limitations.

    This has been the first thing you could really call a game that I made myself.<br />
    It's still unfinished, and it won't ever be, but all the main coding is there.<br />
    To finish it I only had to put in some more content (more objects, levels), but I never came up with new ideas.<br />
    Eventually I got bored of trying to come up with new stuff and creating levels, so I stopped working on it.<br />
    <br />
    In the game itself you have to get crates into a dropbox using conveyors and other objects you can place.<br />
    It also has a constructor to create and test your own levels with.<br />
    The only thing I did not make myself for this game was the music.<br />

    I have helped the developer of this game by coding part of the AI of the enemies.<br />
    That's basically it, it turned out to be quite a funny game to play as well.<br />
    <br />
    In the game you control a spaceship, and you must defend your core/base.<br />
    The enemies will try to take down your shields and base and you should kill them before they do.<br />

    An idea I worked on for a day.<br />
    It's more screensaver than game.<br />
    It's a screensaver with some options you can edit when it's running.<br />
    <br />
    It's a black screen at first, use [Enter] to bring up an info display.<br />
    Use R/Y/G/W/B to toggle red/yellow/green/white/blue colors respectively.<br />
    + &amp; - to toggle the speed of object creation.<br />
    P to pause<br />

    <br />
    DTM is a tool I made for dungeoneering in Runescape.<br />
    It's an interactive multiplayer map that you can use to keep track of where all the obstacles, doors, paths, etc. are in the current dungeon.<br />
    I stopped developing it after I noticed it was too tedious and slowing to keep updating it while also completing a dungeon.<br />
    I still think the idea behind the tool is awesome though =)<br />
    <br />
    My attempt at the same idea a few months before that can be downloaded <a href='/gamemaker/dtm_36.exe'>here (21-6-2010)</a>.<br />
    This one failed because I used the built-in networking system, which did not work at all.<br />
    I discovered that after I had been working on it for a long time though =S<br />
